Notes from 12/5/16 presentation

JW

Comments I thought were important:
	•	Top level script (wrapper) should be "extremely clean and clear" 
	•	In wrapper, put study-specific details "outside of loop" (like TR)
	•	JB would prefer that TR (other info?) is called from a data file - we could write a 'study_parameters' module that gathers this info
	•	For outlier detection, note outlier volumes as a column in an array, then take out after HRF convolution 
	•	Fix slice timing to address problem with first volume
	•	Write a test to check slice timing for a few slices "by hand"
	•	Put in a polynomial drift filter that uses column from outlier detector
	•	Can regress out dummy scans
	•	Extended discussion of whether we can use a contrast (pic - word) to define the ROI for a contrast included within the first (FA-CR) - we'll need to discuss this
Other comments we don't necessarily need to address:
	•	"How noisy are these visual imagery questionnaires?"
	•	Are we just comparing strong and weak memory rather than false memory?
	•	Could check if design and contrast matrices are orthogonal
	•	Is there useful information outside of the ROI?

	•	Adding to "For outlier detection, note outlier volumes as a column in an array, then take out after HRF convolution"--> add the outlier 0/1 column to the design matrix
	•	Adding to"Write a test to check slice timing for a few slices "by hand""--> can use interpolation equation found on Wikipedia
	•	Adding to "Extended discussion of whether we can use a contrast (pic - word) to define the ROI for a contrast included within the first (FA-CR) - we'll need to discuss this"--> check whether the contrast columns are orthogonal to make sure they are valid for use.
