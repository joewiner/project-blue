General group announcements:

- The first project pitch PowerPoint has been uploaded to google drive so that
shared edits can be made in real time without needing to meet in-person. The
goal is to alter the original version to make version for Monday's analysis
pitch.

- Additional '-.py' files have been added to project-blue/code. These are two
suggested preprocessing templates made and provided by group mentor Arielle
Tambini (hence the "AT_-" at front of both filenames.) We may or may not use her
suggested preprocessing because they may rely too heavy on automated programs,
but her suggestions are appreciated!

Next steps for project planning:

Potential preprocessing pipeline-
  Outlier detection
  Slice timing correction
  Motion correction
  Registration

Baseline analysis-
Average of all correct picture trials contrasted with average of all word trials
to find differences in signal between "picture" and "word" conditions.
