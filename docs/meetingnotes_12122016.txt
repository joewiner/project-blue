Melissa will push what she has for the wrapper
One test for wrapper could run a subject through it just to make sure each step works in sequence
Making sure line coverage gets the whole wrapper

To complete:
1. Wrapper (Justin)
2. Test for wrapper (Justin)
3. README - pretty much done
4. Filter - goes into model_signal and goes into event matrix
5. Slice Timing (Joe)
6. Correlation function in wrapper - pick best questionnaire for regression
7. Finalize hypotheses
8. Evaluations
9. Report?

Justin already wrote code for README to get data from website 

We do want to include the first time point - so we should have padding for slice timing

ROI related to visual cortex - pictures vs words
Could use “correct recall” from retrieval trials for the ROI
	“false memory” rather than “false imagery”
ROI: Run 2 [Hits + Correct Rejections] - [Misses + False Alarms]
Analysis: Run 1 [ROI FA] - [ROI CR]
When you incorrectly recalled something - what was going on when you first saw that image

Slice timing test could use formula to manually test slices
